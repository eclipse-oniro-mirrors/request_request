//! Upload module for API 9.
//! 
//! This module provides functions to manage upload tasks in API 9, including
//! creating and deleting upload tasks.

use ani_rs::business_error::BusinessError;
use ani_rs::objects::AniRef;

use crate::api9::bridge::{UploadConfig, UploadTask};

/// Creates an upload task with the given configuration.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `context` - The application context
/// * `config` - The upload configuration containing URL, file path, etc.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(UploadTask)` with a task ID of 0 (placeholder implementation)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use ani_rs::objects::AniRef;
/// use request_api9::api9::upload::upload_file;
/// use request_api9::api9::bridge::UploadConfig;
///
/// // Assuming context is properly initialized
/// let config = UploadConfig {
///     url: "https://example.com/upload".to_string(),
///     file_path: "./local/file.txt".to_string(),
///     // Other configuration fields...
/// };
/// 
/// match upload_file(context, config) {
///     Ok(task) => println!("Upload task created with ID: {}", task.task_id),
///     Err(e) => println!("Error creating upload task: {}", e),
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// # Notes
/// 
/// This is a placeholder implementation that returns a task with ID 0.
#[ani_rs::native]
pub fn upload_file(context: AniRef, config: UploadConfig) -> Result<UploadTask, BusinessError> {
    // Placeholder implementation that returns a task with ID 0
    Ok(UploadTask { task_id: 0 })
}

/// Deletes an upload task.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `this` - The upload task to delete
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(())` unconditionally (placeholder implementation)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use request_api9::api9::upload::delete;
/// use request_api9::api9::bridge::UploadTask;
///
/// let task = UploadTask { task_id: 0 };
/// match delete(task) {
///     Ok(_) => println!("Upload task deleted successfully"),
///     Err(e) => println!("Error deleting upload task: {}", e),
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// # Notes
/// 
/// This is a placeholder implementation that always succeeds.
#[ani_rs::native]
pub fn delete(this: UploadTask) -> Result<(), BusinessError> {
    // Placeholder implementation that always succeeds
    Ok(())
}
